This project provides a simple web-based cache simulator focusing on the implementation of Full Associative Cache with LRU, or Least Recently Used, replacement policy. The simulator is created to provide an interactive way to understand how cache operations work, and how hits and misses are affected by different input parameters.

In a **Full Associative Cache**, any block of memory can be placed in any cache line, reducing cache misses. However, this flexibility requires a replacement policy when the cache is full. The **Least Recently Used (LRU)** policy ensures that the least recently used block is evicted when the cache is full, keeping frequently accessed data in the cache.
